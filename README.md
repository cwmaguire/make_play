# make_play

This is me playing around with Make. I have exercises I did while reading "Manage Projects with GNU Make" (MPWGM) and "The GNU Make Book" (TGMB) as well as other exercises I did just to figure stuff out.

This repo has three different kinds of exercise:
- Makefile - a whole bunch of stuff in one Makefile from MPWGM
- Directories: Stuff I was goofing around with?
- tgmb_ex_*: exercises I created from TGMB

##### MPWGM Examples:

    `make a`<p>
    `make b`<p>
    `make 1.a`<p>

##### TGMB Examples:

    `make -f tgmb_ex_1.1`

See each individual tgmb_ex_* file for how to run it. Some require environment variables to be set.

##### Directory Examples:

    cd copy_file/
    make a

Some directories have a README explaining what the Makefile in that directory explores.
