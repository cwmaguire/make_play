# exercise 1.1
# run this with:
#     foo=foo bar=bar baz=baz quux=quux make -f -e tgmb_ex_1.1 quux=qux2

# print out the value of foo and then where the value came from
$(info $(foo) $(origin foo))

# reset the value of foo and reprint the origin
foo=foo2
$(info $(foo) $(origin foo))

# try to set bar to something else and we'll see that it's still
# set by the environment
# Also demonstrates the firstword function in case we don't care whether
# it was from the environment or an environment override
$(info $(bar) $(origin bar))
bar=bar2
$(info $(bar) $(origin bar) $(firstword $(origin bar)))

# use "override" to overrided the environment even when
# -e / --environment-overrides is used
$(info $(bar) $(origin bar))
override bar=bar2
$(info $(bar) $(origin bar))


# Makefile override overrides command line, which overrides environment variable
# (hint: you can set make variables in the make command line invocation AND in the
#  shell environment)
